You'll Love who you love who you love
You'll Love who you love who you love
My girl she ain't the one that I saw coming
Sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I try to run before but I'm not running anymore
Because I fought against it hard enough to know

That you'll love who you love who you love
You'll love who you love who you love
You'll love who you love who you love
Oh you can't make yourself stop dreaming of who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love then it's who you love

My boy he ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time but you should see him when he shines
Because you never wanna let the feeling go
When you love who you love who you love
You'll love who you love who you love
Yeah you'll love who you love who you love
Oh you can't make yourself stop dreaming of who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love then it's who you love

Oh you'll love who you love who you love
You'll love who you love who you love
You'll love who you love who you love
Oh you can't make yourself stop dreaming of who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love then it's who you love

It's who you love
Who you love
Who we love
Ooo your love yeah yeah yeah
You're the one I love
