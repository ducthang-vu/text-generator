Our lovers' quarrel
(I was thinking about you)
Hurts more than I can say
(And it was kinda dirty)
All night (and the way that you looked at me)
Help me here (it was kinda nasty, ah)
Help me here (it was kinda trashy)
'Cause I can't help my mind from going there
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams
We could (I) be caught (just want this to be perfect)
We're both convicted criminals of thought
('Cause I'm broken)
Let's white (by the one before) glove the bed
(He was kinda nasty, ah)
Help me here (and I feel so trashy)
'Cause we can't hide the evidence in our heads
Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend
Wanna meet at my place?
Heard that we both got nothing to do
When I lay in bed, I touch myself and think of you
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Making love in my sex dreams
Making love in my sex dreams
(Let's keep it naughty, yeah)
Making love in my sex dreams
(Watch me act a fool)
Making love in my sex dreams
Tomorrow when I run into you
Tomorrow when I run into you
You could turn to stone or the color of
Men petrified by a woman
In love, as I am when I lay with you
I think of him, I think of him
I can't believe I'm telling you this
But I've had a couple of drinks and
Oh my god
Last night
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Doing really nasty things (you were in my dreams)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams (you were in my)
Last night (don't stop the party)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
(Let's keep it naughty, yeah)
Doing really nasty things
(Watch me act a fool)
Damn, you were in my sex dreams
(Tomorrow when I run into you)
Making love in my sex dreams
