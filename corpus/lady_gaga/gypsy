When I had known only 18 summers.
I headed west through the Whitley Wood.
To make my fortune and find a lover.
And to lead the best life a young man could.
Lie, La, la lie, la la lie.
Oh La la lie, la la lie, la la lie.
And by the lakeside, just south of Didcot.
I spied an angel just standing there.
She was a traveler, but she was pretty
And clean, she was in the water, washing her hair.
I lost my heart to a lady gypsy.
So long ago, I forget her name.
But I still remember the smell of the flowers
And the way, my life, would never be the same.
She laid me down on a bed of heather
She said, please be careful, this is what I sell
I said, you're a hooker she said, no, I mean the heather.
I sell the heather like a lucky spell.
I said huh, but to be clear then the sex is free
She said, yes, the sex is free the heather is a pound.
I said, I don't need no heather and if I did,
I would just pick some it's free it's growing in the ground.
I lost my heart to a lady gypsy.
So long ago, I forget her name.
But I still remember the smell of the flowers
And the way, my life, would never be the same.
I lost my heart to a lady gypsy.
