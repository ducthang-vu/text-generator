Make it stop!
Silicon, saline, poison, inject me
Baby, I'm a free bitch
I'm a free bitch
Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away, but she won't look back
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess, she's a mess
She's a mess, she's a mess
(Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
(Saline)
Run, run, her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she's howling at him
She looks good, but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still does her dance
She's a tramp, she's a vamp
But she still kills the dance
(Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
She loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
She loves, she loves to dance in the dark
Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia
Tell 'em how you feel, girls
Work your blonde Ben√©t Ramsey
We'll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart
Diana, you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby, yeah
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's looking, she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, loves to dance in the dark
In the dark
