I want your whiskey mouth
All over my blond self
Red wine, cheap perfume
And a filthy pout
Tonight bring all your friends
Because a group does it better
Love is down with a dance
Let's have a full house of leather
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh
Heavy metal lover
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh
Heavy metal lover
Dirty pony, I
Can't wait to hose you down
You've got to earn your love
Down in this part of town
Dirty girls, in a patch
Follow the Remington Rebels
Let's raise hell in the streets
Drink beer and get into trouble
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh
Heavy metal lover
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh
Heavy metal lover
I could be your girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me
If I ruled the world, world, world
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh
Heavy metal lover
Whip me slap me, punk funk
New York clubbers, bump drunk
Dark like liquorice, bar slam
Move it, this is your jam
Wash the night, with St. Jam-eson
Like a baptism,
Heavy metal lovers play
Baby we were born this way
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh
Heavy metal lover
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh
Heavy metal lover
I could be your girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me
If I ruled the world, world, world
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh
Heavy metal lover
