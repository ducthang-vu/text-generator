You're the one that I've been waiting for
Gotta quit this crying
Nobody's gonna heal me, if I don't open the door
Kinda hard to believe, gotta have faith in me
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now it's time to free me from the shame
I gotta find that peace, is it too late?
Or could this love protect me from the pain?
I would battle for you (Even if I break in two)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out (Look at me)
Get down, get down, get down, get down (Look at me)
Freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Look at me now
'Cause all I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah
All I ever wanted was love
Hey, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Hey, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I want your stupid love, love
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
I don't need a reason (Oh)
Not sorry, I want your stupid love
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I want your stupid love, love (Oh, oh, woo)
We got a stupid love, love (Love, love, oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your stupid love, love
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I want your stupid love, love
