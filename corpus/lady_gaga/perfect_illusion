Trying to get control
Pressure's taking its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
Yeah, at least now I know
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Oh, you were a perfect illusion
I don't need eyes to see
I felt you touching me
High like amphetamine
Maybe you're just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm waking up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (perfect illusion)
It was a perfect illusion (But I feel you watching me)
(Dilated, falling free in a modern ecstasy)
(Where are you? 'Cause I can't see you)
It was a perfect illusion (But I feel you watching me)
(But I feel you watching me)
Illusion (But I feel you watching me)
Mistaken for love
(Where are you? 'Cause I can't see you)
(But I feel you watching me)
Mistaken for love (Dilated, falling free)
(In a modern ecstasy) Mistaken for love
(In a modern ecstasy)
(In a modern ecstasy)
I'm over the show
Yeah, at least now I know
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It was a perfect illusion (Perfect illusion)
Oh, you were a perfect illusion
Oh, it was a perfect illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
It was a perfect illusion, illusion, illusion
It was a perfect illusion
Somewhere in all the confusion
You were so perfect
You were a, you were a perfect illusion
