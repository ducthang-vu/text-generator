Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Gaga
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Gaga
When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times, he betrays me
Ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh, ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
Ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh, ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh
A king with no crown, king with no crown
I'm just a holy fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Gaga
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick, you can
Build a house or sink a dead body
Ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh, ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
Ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh, ah-ah, oh-uh-uh-oh
A king with no crown, king with no crown
I'm just a holy fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Ew
In the most biblical sense
I am beyond repentance
Fame, hooker, prostitute wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense
I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me if offenced
Or wear ear condom next time
I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue
And Judas is the demon I cling to, I cling to
Just a holy fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a holy fool, oh, baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah, Judas, Gaga
