Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
I wanna kiss you
But if I do, then I might miss you, babe
It's complicated and stupid
Got my ass squeezed by sexy Cupid
Guess he wants to play, wants to play
A LoveGame, a LoveGame
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans the LoveGame
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans the LoveGame
I'm on a mission
And it involves some heavy touching, yeah
You've indicated your interest
I'm educated in sex, yes
And now I want it bad, want it bad
A LoveGame, a LoveGame
Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute
Maybe three seconds is enough for my heart to quit it
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Don't think too much, just bust that kick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans the LoveGame
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans the LoveGame
I can see you staring there from across the block
With a smile on your mouth, and your hand on your huh!
The story of us, it always starts the same
With a boy, and a girl, and a huh, and a game
And a game, and a game, and a game
A LoveGame
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans the LoveGame
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Dans the LoveGame
Let's play a LoveGame, play a LoveGame
Do you want love, or you want fame?
Are you in the game?
Let's have some fun, this beat is sick (dans the LoveGame)
